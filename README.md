This project implements a machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using the famous Kaggle Titanic dataset. The dataset provides details such as passenger class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, ticket fare, cabin, and port of embarkation.

The aim of the model is to analyze these features and classify whether a passenger would have survived (1) or not (0).

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values (Age, Embarked, Fare, etc.)

Feature engineering (e.g., Family size, Title extraction from Name, etc.)

Encoding categorical features (Sex, Embarked, Titles)

Normalization/Scaling for numerical attributes

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations of survival rates across different classes, genders, and age groups

Correlation heatmaps and distribution plots to understand feature importance

Model Training:

Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms such as:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Gradient Boosting / XGBoost

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV

Model Evaluation:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC metrics

Cross-validation to ensure model robustness

Deployment Ready:

Final trained model can be serialized using joblib or pickle

Integrated prediction function that accepts passenger details and outputs survival prediction
